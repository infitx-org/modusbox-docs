= Transaction Monitoring

PortX Transaction Monitor enables you to monitor B2B _transaction_ data.

A transaction is the full set of end-to-end events (including transmissions, documents, and errors) involved in processing a transmission.

In the Transaction Monitor you can filter and review:

* _Transactions_
* _Transmissions_
* _Errors_ and _Acknowledgements_.
* _Documents_
* _Partner Conversations_


The following page identifies the components of the Transaction Monitor; see also xref:tracking-scenarios.adoc[Tracking Scenarios].
