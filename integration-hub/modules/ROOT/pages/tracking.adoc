= Tracking

For a given message, PortX facilitates storage of:

Payload:: The content of the message

Metadata:: Data about the message

ifndef::camel[]
The 
xref:integration-hub-connector:ROOT:integration-hub-connector.adoc[Integration Hub Connector]
posts:

* Metadata from
the Routing Engine
to the Tracking API
* Payload data within
the Routing Engine to Tracking Data Storage.

The customer then uses xref:index.adoc[Integration Hub] to request and view metadata and payload data, a process which includes the Trading Partner Management API] and Tracking Data Storage. xref:img-tracking-storage-and-retrieval[] illustrates this process

== Payload Tracking

PortX payload tracking is designed to allow extensive customer control. You decide the following:

* Where payloads are stored
* For how long payloads are stored
* Who has access to payloads

=== Metadata Tracking

Metadata tracking is used for searching and viewing. Customers define properties to track, such as:

* Date and time
* Sender
* Recipient
* Payload URL - This URL points to the message payload and is part of metadata tracking; the message payload itself is part of <<Payload Tracking>>.

== Tracking Data Storage

You can store tracking data in either of two ways.

=== Amazon S3

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), provides developers and IT teams with secure, durable, highly-scalable cloud storage. Using this method, you need only create an account and configure account credentials in PortX.

=== Customer-Selected Storage

This method enables a customer to store its message data at a location of its choice. For example, data can be stored in an on-premises database.
