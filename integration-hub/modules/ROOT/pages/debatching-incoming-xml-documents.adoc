= Debatching Incoming XML Document Sets

Product orders sent in XML format are typically enclosed in a parent container. In order to process the product orders, they must be _debatched_: that is, separated so that each product order is enclosed in its parent container, as shown in <<img-xml-debatching>>.

This page shows how GearCo uses xref:document-types.adoc[Document Types] to debatch an XML parent container received from its partner *AAZBoards*.  

== Before you begin

* Make sure that you have xref:partner-configuration.adoc#create-and-configure-partners[created the partner] from which you want to receive documents.

=== Verify Debatching Settings

. To verify that you have configured the Product Order document type to debatch correctly, on the <<img-document-types-xml-complete>>, click the *XML-ParentContainer* document type. 
+
The <<img-document-types-parent-container-detail>> appears. 
. On the <<img-document-types-parent-container-detail>>, click *Children*. 
+
The <<img-document-types-parent-container-detail>> appears.
+
[[img-document-types-parent-container-detail]]
+
image::document-types-parent-container-detail.png[img-document-types-parent-container-detail.png, title="Document Type Page, Children Tab"]
+
Note that:
+
* The Product Order document type that you added in the previous section appears in the *Debatching* section of the tab. 
* Automatic debatching is set to occur for the document type.

Thus, whenever this partner receives a document of the type you created in <<Create Parent Container>>, and the docment contains _x_ XML documents of the type you created in <<Create Child Product Order>>, the parent container document will be debatched into _x_ parent containers, each containing a product order. This process is shown in <<img-xml-debatching>>.

=== About Automatic Debatching

Note that, in <<img-document-type-parents-tab>>, automatic debatching is selected for the GS Document Type, and a shredding path is configured; if you were to view the corresponding page and tab for the GS and ISA documents, you would see that they are also configured in this manner. Thus, when this ISA Document Type is received, it will automatically debatch from an ISA containing a GS containing _x_ 850s to _x_ separate ISAs, each containing a GS and an 850, as shown in <<img-isa-gs-st-debatching>>.
