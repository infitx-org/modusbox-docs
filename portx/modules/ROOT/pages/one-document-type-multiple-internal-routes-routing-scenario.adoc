= One Document Type, Multiple Internal Routes

In this scenario, your organization receives a document from a Partner. IHub has been configured to process the document in two ways:

* Route a copy of the document to an internal API.
* Route a copy of the document to a destination at which all received documents are stored.

== Relationships

There are two relationships in this scenario.

|Relationship|Description|Contains


s|*_YourCompany_ B2B : Any* 
|Universal relationship between your company any partner
|Contains Artifacts used across all partners with whom you do business

s|*_YourCompany_ B2B : A*
|Your organization's relationship with the partner with whom you are doing business (in this case, Partner *A*)
|Contains artifacts used only with Partner *A*

== Artifacts and Artifact Configuration 

This tables and flow diagrams in this section identifies:

* Artifacts that must be configured in order for a given document to be routed (that is, not rejected)
* The Relationship in which the artifacts are configured

== Outcomes

If all artifacts in the following table are configured appropriately, then the outcome of any of a Partners in the scenario sending a document of Document Type *Y* to the Endpoint specific to their relationship with *YourCompany B2B* is that IHub will route the document both to that Endpoint and also to a destination at which all received documents are stored. 

If any artifact in the relationship between the partner and *YourCompany B2B* or in *YourCompany B2B : Any* is incorrectly configured (or not configured at all), then IHub will reject the document.

Integration Manager:

* Receives Document *Y*
* Attempts to resolve routes
** Finds Two Transactions:
*** *Y-to-DocC-to-API*
*** *Y-to-Passthrough*
* Executes both transactions, 
** One transaction maps the document to Document Type *X*, then sends it to Endpoint *API*.
** The other sends the document to the Endpoint *Backup*.
