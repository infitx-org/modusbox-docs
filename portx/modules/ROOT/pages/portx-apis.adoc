:keywords: PortX APIs, PortX Query Language, TRQL

Clients often want to interact with PortX
programmatically to automate their processing tasks.
PortX has two distinct APIs that clients can call:

* *Trading Partner Management Service API* (TPM Service API) - Manages partner-related configurations such as document definitions. +

* *Tracker API* - Gives you access to run-time data such as transactions and business documents. +

== PortX Query Language

Resources having the _Searchable_ trait can be queried through the *q* query parameter
using PortX Query Language (TRQL). TRQL is a SQL-like language giving you
the ability to search for resources by fields other than the resource ID. Before diving into the syntax,
here are a few examples of queries expressed in TRQL:

[source]
name == 'AS2 Receive'

[source]
documentPropertyValue =like= 'GearCo%'

[source]
processedAt > '2016-04-29 00:00:00' and processedAt <= '2016-04-29 00:00:01'

[source]
standard =in= ('X12', 'EDIFACT') and (direction == 'INBOUND' or messageType == 'PO') and processedAt >= '2016-01-01 00:00:00'

A TRQL expression is composed of one or more comparisons, related to each other with logical operators:

* Logical AND: `and`
* Logical OR: `or`

By default, the AND operator takes precedence, that is,
it is evaluated before any OR operators are.
However, a parenthesized expression can be used to change the precedence,
yielding whatever the contained expression yields.

A comparison is composed of a selector, an operator, and an argument:

[source]
comparison = selector, comparison operator, arguments

== TRQL Selector

A selector identifies a field of the resource representation to filter by. It can be
any non-empty Unicode string that does not contain reserved characters (see below) or a white space.

== TRQL Comparison Operator

A comparison operator can be any one of the following:

* Equal to: `==`
* Not equal to: `!=`
* Less than: `<`
* Less than or equal to: `&lt;=`
* Greater than operator: `>`
* Greater than or equal to: `>=`
* In: `=in=`
* Like: `=like=`

== TRQL Argument

An argument can be a single value, or multiple values in parenthesis separated by comma.
Multiple values can only be used with operators that support such argument types like
the _IN_ operator. An argument value that does not contain any reserved character or a
white space can be unquoted, other arguments must be enclosed in single or double quotes.
