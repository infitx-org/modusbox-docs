= Basic Routing Scenario

In this example of a basic routing scenario, your organization receives a xref:glossary#d[document] from a xref:glossary#p[Partner]. 
If PortX has been configured to receive a xref:glossary#d[document] of this xref:glossary#d[Document Type], PortX routes the xref:glossary#d[document] to an internal API. 
If PortX has not been configured to receive a xref:glossary#d[document] of this xref:glossary#d[Document Type], PortX rejects the document.

== Background Reading

xref:actors-relationships-and-artifacts.adoc[Actors, Relationships and Artifacts]:: Introduces foundational PortX terminology. 

xref:transaction-processing-framework.adoc[Transaction-Processing Framework]:: Explains how PortX works. 


== xref:glossary#a[Actor]s

In this scenario, there are three xref:glossary#a[Actor]s: 
    
* Partner A (configured as *PartA*)
* *_YourCompany_ B2B*
* *Any*

== xref:glossary#r[Relationship]s

There are two xref:glossary#r[Relationship]s in this scenario:

|Relationship|Description|Contains

s|_YourCompany_ B2B : Any
|Universal xref:glossary#r[Relationship] between your company and any xref:glossary#a[Actor]
|Contains xref:glossary#a[Artifact]s used across all Partners with whom you do business

s|_YourCompany_ B2B : PartA
|Your organization's xref:glossary#r[Relationship] with the xref:glossary#p[Partner] with whom you are doing business (in this case, *PartA*)
|Contains xref:glossary#a[Artifact]s used only with Partner *PartA*

== xref:glossary#a[Artifact]s 

This section identifies:

* xref:glossary#a[Artifact]s that must be configured in order for the xref:glossary#d[document] in this scenario to be routed (that is, not rejected)
* The xref:glossary#r[Relationship] (either *_YourCompany_ B2B : Any* or *_YourCompany B2B_ : PartA*) in which the xref:glossary#a[Artifact]s are configured

== Outcomes

If the xref:glossary#a[Artifact]s in the previous section have been configured correctly, then xref:glossary#d[document] discussed above will be <<document-accepted-and-routed, accepted and routed>>. 

Otherwise, the xref:glossary#d[document] will be <<document-rejected,rejected>>.



== xref:glossary#d[Document] Accepted and Routed

All xref:glossary#a[Artifact]s are correctly configured; PortX routes an incoming xref:glossary#d[document] of xref:glossary#d[Document Type] *Y* from Partner *PartA* to xref:glossary#e[Endpoint] *RecFromA*.

[[img-basic-routing-scenario-outcome-success]]

PortX:

* Receives a xref:glossary#d[document] of xref:glossary#d[Document Type] *Y* from xref:glossary#e[Endpoint] *RecFromA*
* Attempts to resolve routes
** Finds a Transaction *Y-to-X-to-API* that contains Source xref:glossary#d[Document Type] of xref:glossary#d[Document Type] *Y*    
* Executes Transaction *Y-to-X-to-API*, which transforms the xref:glossary#d[document] from xref:glossary#d[Document Type] *Y* to xref:glossary#d[Document Type] *X*
* Sends the xref:glossary#d[document] to xref:glossary#e[Endpoint] *API*.

== xref:glossary#d[Document] Rejected

Partner *PartA* sends a xref:glossary#d[document] of xref:glossary#d[Document Type] *Z* to xref:glossary#e[Endpoint] *RecFromA*. 
xref:glossary#d[Document Type] *Z* is not configured in xref:glossary#r[Relationship] *_YourCompany_ B2B : Any*; PortX rejects the document. 

[[img-basic-routing-scenario-outcome-rejection]]

image::basic-routing-scenario-outcome-rejection.png[img-basic-routing-scenario-outcome-rejection, title="Basic Routing Scenario Outcome (Rejection)"]

PortX:

* Receives incoming document
* Attempts to resolve Routes
* Does not find a corresponding Transaction
* Rejects the document.
