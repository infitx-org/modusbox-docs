= Content-Based-Routing Routing Scenario

In this example of a content-based routing routing scenario, your organization receives a xref:glossary#d[document] from a xref:glossary#p[Partner]. 

Depending on the size of a property in that document we want to either send that document to an endpoint *DataBig* or an endpoint **DataSmall**.

== Background Reading

xref:actors-relationships-and-artifacts.adoc[Actors, Relationships and Artifacts]:: Introduces foundational IHub terminology. 

xref:transaction-processing-framework.adoc[Transaction-Processing Framework]:: Explains how IHub works.

== xref:glossary#a[Actor]s

In this scenario, there are three xref:glossary#a[Actor]s: 
    
* Partner A (configured as *PartA*)
* *_YourCompany_ B2B*
* *Any*

== Relationships

There are two xref:glossary#r[Relationships] in this scenario:

|===
|Relationship|Description|Contains

s|_YourCompany_ B2B : Any
|Universal relationship between your company any partner
|Contains Artifacts used across all partners with whom you do business

s|_YourCompany_ B2B : PartA
|Your organization's relationship with the partner with whom you are doing business (in this case, *PartA*)
|Contains Artifacts used only with Partner *PartA*

== xref:glossary#a[Artifact]s 

This section identifies:

* Artifacts that must be configured in order for the document in this scenario to be routed (that is, not rejected)
* The Relationship (either *_YourCompany_ B2B : Any* or *_YourCompany B2B_ : PartA*) in which the artifacts are configured

PortX:

* Receives DocY
* Attempts to resolve routes
* Finds two Transactions DocY-to-DocX-to-DataSmall and DocY-to-DocX-to-DataBig
* Evaluates Filters
*** Checks PropertyA for Value
*** Finds PropertyA < 10
** Executes that transaction, which maps the transaction to Document X

**  Sends Document X to Endpoint DATASmall.

=== PartA sends Document Y to Endpoint RecFromA. with PropertyA = 12
