= Routing Scenarios

Pages in this section present examples of scenarios that identify and illustrate:

* PortX (PortX) xref:actors-relationships-and-artifacts.adoc[Actors, Relationships and Artifacts]
* How you can configure these PortX components to implement routing objectives.


== Background Reading

xref:actors-relationships-and-artifacts.adoc[Actors, Relationships and Artifacts]:: Introduces foundational PortX terminology. 

xref:transaction-processing-framework.adoc[Transaction-Processing Framework]:: Explains how PortX works. 


== xref:basic-routing-scenario.adoc[Basic]

[[img-basic-routing-scenario-overview]]

Scenario::
Transmit document from one actor to another by configuring a transaction.

xref:basic-routing-scenario.adoc[Example]::
Your organization receives a document from a Partner. If PortX has been configured to receive a document of this Document Type, PortX routes the document to an internal API. If PortX has not been configured to receive a document of this Document Type, PortX rejects the document.

== xref:shared-routing-scenario.adoc[Shared]

[[img-shared-routing-scenario-overview]]

image::shared-routing-scenario-overview.png[img-shared-routing-scenario-overview, title="Shared Routing Scenario Overview"]

Scenario::
Same action as in xref:basic-routing-scenario.adoc[Basic], but configured in a manner that facilitates the document type going to or coming from multiple Partners.

xref:shared-routing-scenario.adoc[Example]::


Your organization wants to receive a document Document from two Partners, map it to an internal standard, and send it to a backend database.

== xref:override-routing-scenario.adoc[Override]

[[img-override-routing-scenario-overview]]

image::override-routing-scenario-overview.png[img-override-routing-scenario-overview, title="Override Routing Scenario Overview"]

Scenario::
Many Partners use the same Document Type, so that you can reuse a configuration across those partners. This scenario takes into account the possibilityt that some Partners may have slightly different Document Types, requiring the use of a different map.


xref:override-routing-scenario.adoc[Example]::
Your organization expects to receive documents of a single Document Type from multiple Partners.

If PortX has been configured to receive a document of this Document Type, PortX routes the document to an internal API.

However, one partner uses a variation of the Document Type, so you must override the standard Map that you use to transform that partnerâ€™s Document Type to your internal Document Type before routing.

If PortX has not been configured to receive a document of this Document Type, PortX rejects the document.

== xref:multi-route-routing-scenario.adoc[Multi-Route]

[[img-multi-route-routing-scenario-overview]]

image::multi-route-routing-scenario-overview.png[img-multi-route-routing-scenario-overview, title="Multi-Route Routing Scenario Overview"]

Scenario::
A single Document Type is processed by more than one Transaction.

xref:multi-route-routing-scenario.adoc[Example]::

Your organization receives a document from a partner.
PortX has been configured to process the document in two ways:

* Route a copy of the document to an internal API
* Route a copy of the document directly to a destination you use to backup received documents. This routing is referred to as *passthru* because it does not require a map.  

== xref:multicast-routing-scenario.adoc[Multicast]

[[img-multicast-routing-scenario-overview]]

image::multicast-routing-scenario-overview.png[img-multicast-routing-scenario-overview, title="Multicast Routing Scenario Overview"]

Scenario:: 
A Document Type has no *To* field; therefore, it is sent to all Relationships that have Transactions including the Document Type. 


xref:multicast-routing-scenario.adoc[Example]:: 
An Application sends a document to three other Applications. Two of the Applications require the document as-sent; the third requires the payload to be mapped.

== xref:chained-transactions-routing-scenario.adoc[Chained Transactions]

[[img-chained-transactions-routing-scenario-overview]]

image::chained-transactions-routing-scenario-overview.png[img-chained-transactions-routing-scenario-overview, title="Chained Transactions Routing Scenario Overview"]

Scenario::
A Document Type is exchanged between Applications and Partners, where the data is separated into each domain.


xref:chained-transactions-routing-scenario.adoc[Example]::
An Application sends a document to a Partner.

== xref:content-based-routing-routing-scenario.adoc[Content-Based-Routing] 

[[img-content-based-routing-routing-scenario-overview]]

image::content-based-routing-routing-scenario-overview.png[img-content-based-routing-routing-scenario-overview, title="Content-Based Routing Routing Scenario Overview"]

Scenario::
A Document Type is sent to a specific Transaction or Endpoint based on the content contained inside the Document or on the Endpoint.

xref:content-based-routing-routing-scenario.adoc[Example]::
Your organization receives a document from a Partner. Depending on the size of a property in that document, PortX routes the document to an endpoint DataBig or an endpoint DataSmall.
