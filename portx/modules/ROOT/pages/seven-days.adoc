= Seven Days to Integration Hub Mastery

:figure-caption!:


Welcome to Integration Hub! In order to get you started using IHub to integrate partners and applications, we've created a week-long digital integration tour with an IHub expert. Meet the expert and get started with IHub concepts in xref:day-0-video[this video]. Once you've watched it, you're ready to take the tour. 

On Day One, we show you:

* A _video_ in which our expert identifies scenario concepts and shows you the actual IHub screens that enable an example of a basic routing scenario to work.

* A _tutorial_ that provides step-by-step instructions for implementing this example of the scenario in your environment.

After Day One, we replace the tutorial with a _functional overview_ that illustrates the broader concepts of the scenario. 

== Day One: Basic Routing 


We start with one of the most common scenarios in digital integration: Receiving, mapping, and sending a document from a partner to an internal endpoint.

xref:day-one-tutorial.adoc[This tutorial] provides step-by-step instructions for implementing this scenario in your organization. 

== Day Two: Basic Routing, EDI-style 

On Day Two, we take a look at an example of an EDI-centric basic routing scenario, in which your organization receives a xref:glossary#d[document] from a xref:glossary#p[Partner]. 
If IHub has been configured to receive a xref:glossary#d[document] of this xref:glossary#d[Document Type], IHub routes the xref:glossary#d[document] to an internal API. 
If IHub has not been configured to receive a xref:glossary#d[document] of this xref:glossary#d[Document Type], IHub rejects the document. 

So it looks like this:

xref:video[[insert video]].

== Day Three: Shared Routing 

On Day Three, in this example of a shared routing scenario, your organization wants to receive the same xref:glossary#d[Document Type] *Y* from two different xref:glossary#p[Partners], map it to an internal standard Document Type *X*, and send it to a backend API.


So it looks like this:

See how it works in this xref:shared-routing-scenario.adoc[functional overview] while you watch this 
xref:video[[insert video]].

== Day Four: Override Routing

On Day Four, in this example of an override routing scenario, your organization expects to receive xref:glossary#d[document]s of a single xref:glossary#d[Document Type] from multiple xref:glossary#p[Partner]s.


If IHub has been configured to receive a document of this xref:glossary#d[Document Type], IHub routes the document to an internal API. 

However, one partner uses a variation of the Document Type, so you must override the standard xref:glossary#m[Map] that you use to transform that partner's Document Type to your internal Document Type before routing.

If IHub has not been configured to receive a document of this Document Type, IHub rejects the document. 

So it looks like this:


[[img-override-routing-scenario-overview]]

image::override-routing-scenario-overview.png[img-override-routing-scenario-overview, title="Day Four: Override Routing"]

See how it works in this xref:override-routing-scenario.adoc[functional overview] while you watch this 
xref:video[[insert video]].

== Day Five: Multicast Routing

On Day Five, we look at an example of a multicast routing scenario. An xref:glossary#a[Application] sends a xref:glossary#d[Document] to three other Applications. Two of the Applications require the Document as-sent; the third requires the payload to be mapped.

So it looks like this:


[[img-multicast-routing-scenario-overview]]

image::multicast-routing-scenario-overview.png[img-multicast-routing-scenario-overview, title="Day Five: Multicast Routing"]

See how it works in this xref:multicast-routing-scenario.adoc[functional overview] while you watch this 
xref:video[[insert video]].

== Day Six: Chained Routing

On Day Six, we look at an example of a chained-transactions routing scenario. An xref:glossary#a[Application] sends a xref:glossary#d[Document] to a xref:glossary#p[Partner].

It looks like this: 

[[img-chained-transactions-routing-scenario-overview]]

image::chained-transactions-routing-scenario-overview.png[img-chained-transactions-routing-scenario-overview, title="Day Six: Chained Transactions"]

See how it works in this xref:chained-transactions-routing-scenario.adoc[functional overview] while you watch this 
xref:video[[insert video]].
