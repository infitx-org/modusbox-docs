= Seven Days to PortX Mastery

Welcome to PortX! In order to get you started using PortX to integrate partners and applications, we've created a week-long digital integration tour with a PortXpert. 

== Day Zero
Meet the -xpert and let them show you the beauty and simplicity of PortX concepts in https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tf4UMPMRc6uvD7uQU8WQ8gSWLBhhPXC7/view?usp=sharing[this video]. 


== Day One: Basic Routing, already

Believe it or not, after Day Zero, you are al _ready_ ready to build your first integration (we call them PortXtegrations, but we are a little bashful about that - a lot of decision-makers tell us this stuff is not supposed to be fun). We start with one of the most common scenarios in digital integration: Receiving, mapping, and sending a document from a partner to an internal endpoint. 

* https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mxJ0i81XEuC7RysDlt-iKOFE3WUmZM-V/view?usp=sharing[Day One: Let the people build their first PortXtegration] tells the story of a basic routing scenario.
Our PortXpert identifies scenario concepts and shows you the actual PortX pages that enable such a scenario to work.

* People pick this stuff up so quickly that as early as Day One, we introduce a xref:glide-path.adoc[glide path] (technically a PortXtreme Glide Path), but we haven't heard back about the trademark yet) that, for the people's first integration, gives you just the facts: 

* PortX Page
* Button, Box or Dropdown list
* Action or Value
* Elapsed Time

== Day Two: Basic Routing, EDI-style 

On Day Two, we take a look at an example of an EDI-centric basic routing scenario, in which your organization receives a xref:glossary#d[document] from a xref:glossary#p[Partner]. 
If PortX has been configured to receive a xref:glossary#d[document] of this xref:glossary#d[Document Type], PortX routes the xref:glossary#d[document] to an internal API. 
If PortX has not been configured to receive a xref:glossary#d[document] of this xref:glossary#d[Document Type], PortX rejects the document. 

So it looks like this:

== Day Three: Shared Routing 

On Day Three, in this example of a shared routing scenario, your organization wants to receive the same xref:glossary#d[Document Type] *Y* from two different xref:glossary#p[Partners], map it to an internal standard Document Type *X*, and send it to a backend API.


So it looks like this:

xref:video[[insert video]].

== Day Four: Override Routing

On Day Four, in this example of an override routing scenario, your organization expects to receive xref:glossary#d[document]s of a single xref:glossary#d[Document Type] from multiple xref:glossary#p[Partner]s.


If PortX has been configured to receive a document of this xref:glossary#d[Document Type], PortX routes the document to an internal API. 

However, one partner uses a variation of the Document Type, so you must override the standard xref:glossary#m[Map] that you use to transform that partner's Document Type to your internal Document Type before routing.

If PortX has not been configured to receive a document of this Document Type, PortX rejects the document. 

So it looks like this:


[[img-override-routing-scenario-overview]]

image::override-routing-scenario-overview.png[img-override-routing-scenario-overview, title="Day Four: Override Routing"]

See how it works in this xref:override-routing-scenario.adoc[functional overview] while you watch this 
xref:video[[insert video]].

== Day Five: Multicast Routing

On Day Five, we look at an example of a multicast routing scenario. An xref:glossary#a[Application] sends a xref:glossary#d[Document] to three other Applications. Two of the Applications require the Document as-sent; the third requires the payload to be mapped.

So it looks like this:


[[img-multicast-routing-scenario-overview]]

image::multicast-routing-scenario-overview.png[img-multicast-routing-scenario-overview, title="Day Five: Multicast Routing"]

See how it works in this xref:multicast-routing-scenario.adoc[functional overview] while you watch this 
xref:video[[insert video]].

== Day Six: Chained Routing

On Day Six, we look at an example of a chained-transactions routing scenario. An xref:glossary#a[Application] sends a xref:glossary#d[Document] to a xref:glossary#p[Partner].

It looks like this: 

[[img-chained-transactions-routing-scenario-overview]]

image::chained-transactions-routing-scenario-overview.png[img-chained-transactions-routing-scenario-overview, title="Day Six: Chained Transactions"]

xref:video[[insert video]].
