= Override Routing Scenario

In this example of an override routing scenario, your organization expects to receive xref:glossary#d[document]s of a single xref:glossary#d[Document Type] from multiple xref:glossary#p[Partner]s.


If PortX has been configured to receive a document of this xref:glossary#d[Document Type], PortX routes the document to an internal API. 

However, one partner uses a variation of the Document Type, so you must override the standard xref:glossary#m[Map] that you use to transform that partner's Document Type to your internal Document Type before routing.

If PortX has not been configured to receive a document of this Document Type, PortX rejects the document.

== Background Reading

xref:actors-relationships-and-artifacts.adoc[Actors, Relationships and Artifacts]:: Introduces foundational PortX terminology. 

xref:transaction-processing-framework.adoc[Transaction-Processing Framework]:: Explains how PortX works.

== xref:glossary#a[Actor]s

In this scenario, there are three xref:glossary#a[Actor]s: 
    
* Partner A (configured as *PartA*)
* Partner B (configured as *PartB*)
* Partner C (configured as *PartC*)
* *_YourCompany_ B2B*
* *Any*


== Relationships

There are four xref:glossary#r[Relationships] in this scenario. Artifacts are distributed among the relationships according to how they are used. For example, the internal Endpoint *API* is used in all scenarios, so it is configured in the **_YourCompany_ B2B* : Any* Relationship. The Endpoints *RecFromA*, *RecFromB,* and *RecFromC* are used only by specific partners; therefore they are configured in the relationships that correspond to those partners. 
<<Override Routing Scenario Relationships, Table 1>> describes these Relationships and identifies their contents.

|Relationship|Description|Contains


s|*_YourCompany_ B2B* : Any 
|Universal relationship between your company any partner
|Contains Artifacts used across all partners with whom you do business

s|*_YourCompany_ B2B* : PartA
|Your organization's relationship with the partner with whom you are doing business (in this case, *PartA*)
|Contains artifacts used only with Partner *PartA*

s|*_YourCompany_ B2B* : PartB
|Your organization's relationship with Partner *\|B*
|Contains artifacts used only with Partner *PartB*

s|*_YourCompany_ B2B* : PartC
|Your organization's relationship with Partner *PartC*

== Artifacts

This tables and flow diagrams in this section identifies:

* Artifacts that must be configured in order for a given document to be routed (that is, not rejected)
* The Relationship in which the artifacts are configured

=== *_YourCompany_ B2B* : Any

Artifacts in this Relationship are accessible from all Partner Relationships. 
Therefore, these artifacts, tabulated in <<Override Routing Scenario Artifacts - *_YourCompany_ B2B* : Any, Table 2>>, appear in each of the Transaction diagrams that follow.

== Outcomes

If all artifacts in the following table are configured appropriately, then the outcome of any of the partners in the scenario sending a document of *Y* to the Endpoint specific to their relationship with **_YourCompany_ B2B** is that PortX will route the document to that Endpoint. 

If any artifact in the relationship between the partner and **_YourCompany_ B2B** or in **_YourCompany_ B2B* : Any* is incorrectly configured (or not configured at all), then PortX will reject the document.
