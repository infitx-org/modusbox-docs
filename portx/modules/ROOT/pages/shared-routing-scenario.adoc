== Background Reading

xref:actors-relationships-and-artifacts.adoc[Actors, Relationships and Artifacts]:: Introduces foundational IHub terminology. 

xref:transaction-processing-framework.adoc[Transaction-Processing Framework]:: Explains how IHub works.

== xref:glossary#a[Actor]s

In this scenario, there are three xref:glossary#a[Actor]s: 
    
* Partner A (configured as *PartA*)
* Partner B (configured as *PartB*)
* *_YourCompany_ B2B*
* *Any*


== Relationships

There are three  xref:glossary#r[Relationships] in this scenario:

.Shared Routing Scenario Relationships
[cols="3*"]

|===
|Relationship|Description|Contains

s|_YourCompany_ B2B : Any
|Universal relationship between your company any partner
|Contains a rtifacts used across all partners with whom you do business

s|_YourCompany_ B2B : PartA
|Your organization's relationship with the partner with whom you are doing business (in this case, *PartA*)
|Contains artifacts used only with Partner *PartA*

s|_YourCompany_ B2B : PartB
|Your organization's relationship with the partner with whom you are doing business (in this case, *PartB*)
|Contains artifacts used only with Partner *PartB*

== xref:glossary#a[Artifact]s 

This section identifies:

* Artifacts that must be configured in order for the document in this scenario to be routed (that is, not rejected)
* The Relationship (either *__YourCompany__ B2B : Any* or *__YourCompany__ B2B : PartA*, or *__YourCompany__ B2B : PartB*) in which the artifacts are configured

== Outcomes

=== Document Accepted and Routed

==== *PartA* sends Document of Document Type *Y* to Endpoint *RecFromA*

Integration Manager:

* Receives Document *Y*
** Attempts to resolve routes
** Finds Transaction *Y-to-X-to-API*
* Executes that transaction, which maps the transaction to *X*
*  Sends Document *X* to Endpoint *API*.

Integration Manager:

* Receives Document *Y*
* Attempts to resolve routes
** Finds Transaction *Y-to-X-to-API*
** Executes that transaction, which maps the transaction to *X*

=== Document Rejected

==== PartC sends Document of Document Type *Y* to Endpoint *RecFromB*

[[img-shared-routing-scenario-outcome-rejection]]

image::shared-routing-scenario-outcome-rejection.png[img-shared-routing-scenario-outcome-rejection, title="Shared Scenario Outcome (Rejection)"]

Integration Manager:
