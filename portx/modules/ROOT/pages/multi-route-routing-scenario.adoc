= Multi-Route Routing Scenario

In this example of a multi-route routing scenario, your organization receives a 
xref:glossary#d[Document] from a xref:glossary#p[Partner].
IHub has been configured to process the document in two ways:

* Route a copy of the document to an internal API
* Route a copy of the document directly to a destination you use to backup received documents. This routing is referred to as *passthru* because it does not require a map.

== Background Reading

xref:actors-relationships-and-artifacts.adoc[Actors, Relationships and Artifacts]:: Introduces foundational IHub terminology. 

xref:transaction-processing-framework.adoc[Transaction-Processing Framework]:: Explains how IHub works.

== xref:glossary#a[Actor]s

In this scenario, there are three xref:glossary#a[Actor]s: 
    
* Partner A (configured as *PartA*)
* *_YourCompany_ B2B*
* *Any*

== Relationships

There are two relationships in this scenario.

[cols="3*"]

s|*_YourCompany_ B2B : Any* 
|Universal relationship between your company any partner
|Contains Artifacts used across all partners with whom you do business

s|*_YourCompany_ B2B : PartA*
|Your organization's relationship with the partner with whom you are doing business (in this case, Partner *PartA*)
|Contains artifacts used only with *PartA*

== xref:glossary#a[Artifact]s 

The tables and flow diagrams in this section identify:

* Artifacts that must be configured in order for a given document to be routed (that is, not rejected)
* The Relationship in which the artifacts are configured

== Outcomes

If all artifacts in the following table are configured appropriately, then the outcome of any of a Partners in the scenario sending a document of Document Type *Y* to the Endpoint specific to their relationship with *YourCompany B2B* is that IHub will route the document both to that Endpoint and also to a destination at which all received documents are stored. 

If any artifact in the relationship between the partner and *YourCompany B2B* or in *YourCompany B2B : Any* is incorrectly configured (or not configured at all), then IHub will reject the document.

Integration Manager:

* Receives Document *Y*
* Attempts to resolve routes
** Finds Two Transactions:
*** *Y-to-DocC-to-API*
*** *Y-to-Passthrough*
* Executes both transactions, 
** One transaction maps the document to Document Type *X*, then sends it to Endpoint *API*.
** The other sends the document to the Endpoint *Backup*.
